## factorio_mod
made a simple mod for myself to "dig" calcite from water on Nauvis because I couldn't figure out how to automate space platform shipments, I also didn't like the concept of shipping 5 different things from Vulcanus where a rocket only holds like 4 foundries and I need 20 for my build, so I'll probably add more off-planet resources to Nauvis if I ever need it, the reason why from water is because wikipedia said calcite can be found in water

currently missing in-game recipe but i'll fix that one day maybe
